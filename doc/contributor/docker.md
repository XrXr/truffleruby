# Testing TruffleRuby Using Docker

The `jt docker` tool can be used to generate `Dockerfiles` for testing
TruffleRuby on multiple Linux distributions in multiple configurations.

We don't use Docker in a very Docker-like way - we could be using something like
Vagrant instead.

You need to have Docker installed.

For example, to build a Docker image called `truffleruby-test` to test
installing the public GraalVM CE binary and the public Ruby installable,
and running a basic test:

```bash
$ jt docker build truffleruby-test --ubuntu1804 --public 1.0.0 --basic-test
```

Note that running a test will fail the `build` command, so building the image
is itself a test. You can then also log into the image after it's successfully
built to use TruffleRuby.

Or, to print a Dockerfile to show how to install TruffleRuby from source on
Fedora:

```bash
$ jt docker print --fedora28 --source
```

Or, to run a full set of tests on a set of new release candidate tarballs:

```bash
$ jt docker test --graalvm graalvm-ce.tar.gz llvm-toolchain-installable.jar:ruby-installable-ce.jar --test release_branch
$ jt docker test --graalvm graalvm-ee.tar.gz llvm-toolchain-installable.jar:ruby-installable-ee.jar --test release_branch
$ jt docker test --graalvm graalvm-ee.tar.gz llvm-toolchain-installable.jar:ruby-installable-ee.jar --rebuild-images native-image-installable-ee.jar --test release_branch
$ jt docker test --standalone truffleruby-linux-amd64.tar.gz --test release_branch
```

## Distributions

Pick one of:

* Oracle Linux 7, `--ol7` (default)
* Ubuntu 18.04 `--ubuntu1804`
* Ubuntu 16.04 `--ubuntu1604`
* Fedora 28, `--fedora28`

## Methods of installing

Pick one of:

* From the public GraalVM CE binary tarball, and the public Ruby component, `--public 1.0.0` (default)
* From a GraalVM binary tarball and Ruby component you have locally, `--graalvm graalvm.tar.gz llvm-toolchain-installable.jar:ruby-installable.jar`
* From a TruffleRuby standalone distribution you have locally, `--standalone truffleruby-1.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
* From source, `--source master`

## What to do

Pick any of:

* Nothing (default)
* Run a basic test of installing and using a few gems (needs network access), `--basic-test`
* Run a full set of tests (needs network access, and a branch of the repo to test against), `--test master`

## Other options

* Print the Dockerfile rather than building it, `print` instead of `build`
* Rebuild `polyglot` and `libpolyglot` images after installing the Ruby component, `--rebuild-images`
* Run a full set of Docker tests we care about, `test` instead of `build`
* Do not rebuild `openssl`, to test error messages, `--no-rebuild-openssl`

When using `test` you need to specify the method of installing, and what to do.

## Docker cache

You may find that the Docker cache interacts badly with these Dockerfiles (such
as repository URLs being cached that become unavailable). Therefore we recommend
regularly clearing your Docker cache.

```bash
$ docker system prune -a -f
```

## Version incompatibilities

Some of our Docker configurations are a bit fragile, and trying to run Docker
to install old binaries, or using old versions of branches in the source
repository, may not work.

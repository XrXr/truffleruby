# Truffle Interop

TruffleRuby supports the standard interop message system of the Truffle
Language Implementation Framework. This document explains what it does when it
receives them, how to get it to explicitly send them, how to get it to send
them using more idiomatic Ruby, and how what messages it sends for normal Ruby
operations on foreign objects.

This document only explains how TruffleRuby uses messages. The messages
themselves are explained in the
[Truffle JavaDoc](http://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/interop/Message.html).

There is a separate document aimed at people using interop to write
[polyglot programs](../user/polyglot.md). This document gives more internal
details.

## How Ruby responds to messages

### `IS_EXECUTABLE`

Returns true only for instances of `Method` and `Proc`.

### `EXECUTE`

Calls either a `Method` or `Proc`, passing the arguments as you'd expect.
Doesn't pass a block.

### `INVOKE`

Calls the method with the name you provided, passing the arguments as you'd
expect. Doesn't pass a block.

### `IS_INSTANTIABLE`

Returns if the object responds to `new`.

### `NEW`

Calls `new`, passing the arguments as you'd expect.

### `HAS_SIZE`

Returns `true` only for `Array`.

### `GET_SIZE`

Call `size` on the object.

### `IS_BOXED`

Returns true only for instances of `String`, `Symbol`.

### `UNBOX`

For a `String` or `Symbol`, produces a `java.lang.String`, similar to
`Truffle::Interop.to_java_string`.

### `IS_POINTER`

Calls `polyglot_pointer?` if the object responds to it, otherwise returns `false`.

### `AS_POINTER`

Calls `polyglot_address` if the object responds to it, otherwise throws
`UnsupportedMessageException`.

### `TO_NATIVE`

Calls `to_native` if the object responds to it, otherwise throws
`UnsupportedMessageException`.

### `IS_NULL`

Returns true only for the `nil` object.

### `HAS_KEYS`

Returns true, except for `Array` and `String`.

### `KEYS`

If the receiver is a Ruby `Hash`, return the hash keys converted to strings.

Otherwise, if there is a method `[]` defined, return an empty array.

(The convention is that every value returned from `KEYS` could be `READ`, which
we can't guarantee for a user `[]` method, so we don't return any `KEYS`.)

Otherwise, return all method names via `receiver.methods`, and instance
variable names if the `internal` flag is set.

Keys are returned as a Ruby `Array` containing Java `String` objects or
integers.

### `KEY_INFO`

If the receiver is a Ruby `Hash`:

- `READABLE` will be set for key that exists.

- `INSERTABLE` will be set if the hash is not frozen and key does not exist.

- `MODIFIABLE` and `REMOVABLE`  will be set if the key is found and the hash is
  not frozen.

- `INVOCABLE` and `INTERNAL` will not be set.

Otherwise, if the receiver is a Ruby `Array`:

- `READABLE` will set if the name is an integer and in bounds.

- `INSERTABLE` will be set if the index is out of bounds 
  and the array is not frozen. 

- `MODIFIABLE` will be set if the index is an integer, in
  bounds and the array is not frozen.

- `REMOVABLE` is set for any index in bounds.

- `INVOCABLE` and `INTERNAL` will not be set.

Otherwise if the name starts with an `@`:

- `READABLE` will be set if the variable exists

- `INSERTABLE` will be set if the object is not frozen and the instance variable
  does not exists.

- `MODIFIABLE` and `REMOVABLE` will be set if the instance variable exists and
  the object is not frozen.

- `INVOCABLE` will not be set.

- `INTERNAL` will be set.

Otherwise:

- `READABLE` will be set if the object has a method of that name, or the object
  has a `[]` method.

- `MODIFIABLE` will be set if the object has a `[]=` method.

- `INSERTABLE` will not be set

- `REMOVABLE` and `INTERNAL` will not be set.

- `INVOCABLE` will be set if the object has a method of that name.

For all objects:

- `EXISTING` is set if `READABLE`, `MODIFIABLE`, `INVOCABLE`, `INTERNAL` or
  `REMOVABLE` are set.

### `READ`

If the receiver is a Ruby `Array` or `Hash`, call `receiver[name/index]`.

Otherwise if the name starts with an `@` it is read as an instance variable.

Otherwise, if there is a method `[]` defined on the receiver and the receiver 
is not a Proc, call `receiver[name/index]`.

Otherwise, if there is a method defined on the object with the same name, return
it as a (bound) `Method`.

Otherwise, throw `UnknownIdentifierException`.

### `WRITE`

If the receiver is a Ruby `Array` or `Hash`, call
`receiver[name/index] = value`.

Otherwise if the name starts with an `@` it is set as an instance variable.

Otherwise, if there is a method called `[]=` on the receiver, call
`receiver[name/index] = value`.

Otherwise, throw `UnknownIdentifierException`.

### `REMOVE`

If the receiver is a Ruby `Array` and the name is an integer, delete the element
at the index indicated by the name value. If the index is out of bounds then, in
keeping with Ruby semantics, no-op. If the name value is not an integer, then
`UnknownIdentifierException` is thrown.

Otherwise, if the receiver is a Ruby `Hash`, delete the key indicated by the
name value. If no such key exists then, in keeping with Ruby semantics, no-op.

Otherwise, if the name starts with an `@` remove it as an instance variable.

Otherwise, throw `UnknownIdentifierException`.

## What messages are sent for Ruby syntax on foreign objects

TruffleRuby automatically provides these special methods on a foreign object.
They have priority over methods that the foreign object actually provides.

`object[name/index]` (`#[](name/index)`) sends `READ`.

`object[name/index] = value` (`#[]=(name/index, value)`) sends `WRITE`.

`object.delete(name/index)` sends `REMOVE`.

`object.call(*args)` sends `EXECUTE`.

`object.nil?` sends `IS_NIL`.

`object.size` sends `SIZE`.

`object.keys` sends `KEYS`.

`object.name` sends `INVOKE`.

`object + other` and other operator method calls (method name not beginning with
a letter) will send `IS_BOXED` on `object` and based on that will possibly
`UNBOX` it, convert to Ruby, and then call the method on the unboxed version.

`object.name(*args)` sends `INVOKE`.

`object.new(*args)` sends `NEW`.

`object.class` sends `READ(class)` for a Java `Class` object, otherwise sends an
`INVOKE` as normal.

`object.to_a` and `object.to_ary` calls `Truffle::Interop.to_array(object)`.

`object.equal?(other)` returns whether `object` is the same as `other` using
reference equality, like `BasicObject#equal?`. For Java interop objects it
looks at the underlying Java object.

`object.inspect` produces a Ruby-style inspect string - see
[notes on inspect strings](#notes-on-inspect-strings) below.

`object.to_s` calls `object.inspect`.

`object.to_str` will try to `UNBOX` the object and return it if it's a `String`,
or will raise `NoMethodError` if it isn't.

`java_object.is_a?(java_class)` does `java_object instanceof java_class`, using
the host object instance, rather than any runtime interop wrapper.

`object.is_a?(java_class)` does `object instanceof java_class`, using the
runtime object instance.

`foreign_object.is_a?(ruby_class)` returns `false`.

`foreign_object.is_a?(foreign_class)` raises a `TypeError`.

`foreign_object.kind_of?` works like `foreign_object.is_a?`.

`object.respond_to?(:to_a)`, `respond_to?(:to_ary)` and `respond_to?(:size)`
sends `HAS_SIZE`.

`object.respond_to?(:call)` sends `EXECUTABLE`.

`object.respond_to?(:new)` sends `IS_INSTANTIABLE`.

`object.respond_to?(:class)` calls `Truffle::Interop.java_class?(object)`.

`object.respond_to?(:inspect)`, `:to_s`, `:is_a?`, is `true`.

`object.respond_to?(:to_str)` is `true` if the object `UNBOXes` to a `String`.

`object.respond_to?(name)` for other names returns `false`.

`object.__send__(name, *args)` works in the same way as literal method call on
the foreign object, including allowing the special-forms listed above (see
[notes on method resolution](#notes-on-method-resolution)).

## String conversion

Ruby strings and symbols are unboxable to Java strings.

A call from Ruby to a foreign language using `NEW`, `EXECUTE`, `INVOKE`, `READ`,
`WRITE`, or `UNBOX`, that has Ruby strings or symbols as arguments, will convert
each Ruby string or symbol argument to a Java string. You can avoid this
conversion for `EXECUTE` using `Truffle::Interop.execute_without_conversion`,
for `READ` using `Truffle::Interop.read_without_conversion`, and for `UNBOX`
using `Truffle::Interop.unbox_without_conversion`.

`Truffle::Interop.keys` converts Java string key names to Ruby strings, so it
also has a `Truffle::Interop.keys_without_conversion` equivalent.

A call from Ruby to a foreign language using `NEW`, `EXECUTE`, `INVOKE`, `READ`,
`WRITE`, or `UNBOX`, that returns a Java string will convert the returned string
to a Ruby string.

A call from a foreign language to Ruby using `NEW`, `EXECUTE`, `INVOKE`, or
`WRITE`, that has Java strings as arguments, will convert each Java string
argument to a Ruby string.

A call from a foreign language to Ruby `NEW`, `EXECUTE`, `INVOKE` or `READ`
that returns a Ruby string will not convert it to a Java string, as this would
break our C extension support which uses these messages to get Ruby objects
and expects to be able to mutate them and so on
(compare with `Truffle::Interop.execute_without_conversion`).

Export and import also converts strings, and also has `_without_conversion`
counterparts.

Boxed foreign strings (foreign objects that respond positively to `IS_BOXED` and
`UNBOX` to a Java string) unbox on `to_s`, `to_str` and `inspect`.

## Import and export

`Truffle::Interop.export(:name, value)`

`Truffle::Interop.export_method(:name)` (looks for `name` in `Object`)

`value = Truffle::Interop.import(:name)`

`Truffle::Interop.import_method(:name)` (defines `name` in `Object`)

## Interop Eval

`Truffle::Interop.eval(mime_type, source)`

`Truffle::Interop.import_file(path)` evals an entire file, guessing the correct
language MIME type.

## Java interop

`Truffle::Interop.java_type(name)` returns a Java class object, given a name
such as `java.lang.Integer` or `int[]`.

`java_class.new(*args)` creates a new instance of a Java class object.

`Truffle::Interop.from_java_array(array)` creates a shallow copy of a Java
array as a Ruby array.

## Additional methods

`Truffle::Interop.mime_type_supported?(mime_type)` reports if a language's MIME
type is supported for interop.

`Truffle::Interop.foreign?(object)`

`Truffle::Interop.java?(object)`

`Truffle::Interop.java_class?(object)`

`Truffle::Interop.java_instanceof?(object, class)`

`Truffle::Interop.java_string?(object)`

`Truffle::Interop.to_java_string(ruby_string)`

`Truffle::Interop.from_java_string(java_string)`

`Truffle::Interop.enumerable(object)` gives you an `Enumerable` interface to a
foreign object.

`Truffle::Interop.to_java_array(array)` gives you a proxied Java array copied
from the Ruby array.

`Truffle::Interop.java_array(a, b, c...)` a literal variant of the former.

`Truffle::Interop.to_java_collection(array)` gives you a proxied Java `List`
copied from the Ruby array.

`Truffle::Interop.to_java_map(hash)` gives you a proxied Java `HashMap`
copied from the Ruby hash.

`Truffle::Interop.deproxy(object)` deproxy a Java object if it has been proxied.

`Truffle::Interop.to_array(object)` converts to a Ruby array by calling
`GET_SIZE` and sending `READ` for each index from zero to the size.

`Truffle::Interop.to_hash(object)` converts to a Ruby hash by reading all
members.

`Truffle::Interop.meta_object(object)` returns the Truffle meta-object that
describes the object (unrelated to the metaclass).

`Truffle::Interop.unbox_if_needed(object)` calls `UNBOX` on an object if
`IS_BOXED` and it's a foreign object.

`Truffle::Interop.to_string(object)` calls the Java `toString` on the object.

`Truffle::Interop.identity_hash_code(object)` calls
`System.identityHashCode(object)`.

## Notes on method resolution

Method calls on foreign objects are usually translated exactly into foreign
`READ`, `INVOKE` and other messages. The other methods listed in
[what messages are sent for Ruby syntax on foreign objects](#what-messages-are-sent-for-ruby-syntax-on-foreign-objects)
are a kind of special-form - they are implemented as a special case in the
call-site logic. They are not being provided by `BasicObject` or `Kernel` as you
may expect. This means that for example `#method` isn't available, and you can't
use it to get the method for `#to_a` on a foreign object, as it is a
special-form, not a method.

Interop ignores visibility entirely.

## Notes on inspect strings

TruffleRuby has the following rules for how to generate an `inspect` string
for a foreign object (where `id` is the identity hash code):

* If an object is a Java `null`, format as `#<Java null>`
* Otherwise, if an object is a Java array, list, or something else with `HAS_SIZE`, format as `#<Java:0xid [a, b, c...]>`
* Otherwise, if an object is a Java map, format as `#<Java:0xid {"key"=>value, "key"=>value...}>`
* Otherwise, if an object is a Java class, format as `#<Java class MyJavaClassName>`
* Otherwise, if an object is a Java object, format as `#<Java:0xid object MyJavaClassName>`
* Otherwise, if an object is `null` (`IS_NULL`), format as `#<Foreign null>`
* Otherwise, if an object is a pointer (`IS_POINTER)`), format as `#<Foreign pointer 0xaddress>`
* Otherwise, if an object is an array (`HAS_SIZE`), format as `#<Foreign:0xid [a, b, c...]>`
* Otherwise, if an object is a executable (`IS_EXECUTABLE`), format as `#<Foreign:0xid proc>`
* Otherwise, format as `#<Foreign:0xid "member"=value, "member"=value...>`

## Notes on coercion

Methods such as `Kernel.Integer`, `Kernel.Float`, `Numeric#coerce` will call
`Truffle::Interop.unbox_if_needed` on objects, in order to unbox any boxed
foreign objects, before continuing with the normal coercion routine.

## Notes on source encoding

Sources created from the Polyglot API only contain a Java `String` and the
original bytes are not available to be re-interpreted in a different encoding
from the one already to create it. Therefore TruffleRuby interprets these
sources as UTF-8 and cannot set the file encoding using a magic comment, except
for encodings which are sub-sets of UTF-8, such as 7-bit ASCII.
